## What Are Layouts?

Layouts are Astro components that wrap page content in a reusable shell. They provide the shared structure that appears on every page — the `<html>` document, `<head>` tags, navigation, sidebars, and footers.

If you've used Next.js's `layout.tsx` files or wrapped your React app in a `<Layout>` component, the concept is identical. The difference is in the mechanism: Astro uses `<slot />` instead of `{children}`.

## A Minimal Layout

Here's the simplest possible layout:

```astro
---
// src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro
interface Props {
  title: string;
}
const { title } = Astro.props;
---

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>{title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>
```

And a page using it:

```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
---

<BaseLayout title="Home">
  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>This content fills the slot in BaseLayout.</p>
</BaseLayout>
```

The `<slot />` in the layout is replaced by everything between the opening and closing `<BaseLayout>` tags. The result is a complete HTML document with the page content injected into the body.

<Callout type="tip" title="Coming from React?">
  In React, you'd write `{children}` inside a layout component. Astro's `<slot />` works the same way but uses the web-standard slot API (also used in Web Components and Vue). The visual result is identical — content flows from the page into the layout.
</Callout>

## This Project's BaseLayout

Let's look at the actual `BaseLayout.astro` used by this course. It demonstrates several real-world patterns:

```astro
---
import { ClientRouter } from 'astro:transitions';
import BaseHead from '../components/BaseHead.astro';
import Header from '../components/Header.astro';
import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
import '../styles/global.css';

interface Props {
  title: string;
  description: string;
}

const { title, description } = Astro.props;
---

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <BaseHead title={title} description={description} />
    <ClientRouter />
  </head>
  <body>
    <Header />
    <main>
      <slot />
    </main>
    <Footer />
  </body>
</html>
```

Key things to notice:

1. **Importing CSS** — `import '../styles/global.css'` loads global styles. Astro processes and bundles this automatically.
2. **Component composition** — `BaseHead`, `Header`, and `Footer` are separate components imported into the layout. Each one is reusable and independently maintainable.
3. **View Transitions** — `<ClientRouter />` enables smooth page transitions with one line. We cover this in Lesson 5.1.
4. **Props for SEO** — The layout accepts `title` and `description` which are passed to `BaseHead` for meta tags.

## Nested Layouts

Layouts can wrap other layouts. This course uses two levels:

- **BaseLayout** — The HTML shell, global styles, header, footer
- **LessonLayout** — Extends BaseLayout with a sidebar, table of contents, and lesson navigation

```astro
---
// src/layouts/LessonLayout.astro (simplified)
import BaseLayout from './BaseLayout.astro';
import Sidebar from '../components/Sidebar.astro';
import LessonNav from '../components/LessonNav.astro';

const { title, description, prev, next } = Astro.props;
---

<BaseLayout title={title} description={description}>
  <div class="lesson-layout">
    <aside>
      <Sidebar />
    </aside>
    <article>
      <slot />
    </article>
  </div>
  <LessonNav prev={prev} next={next} />
</BaseLayout>
```

The nesting works because `<slot />` in BaseLayout receives everything inside `<BaseLayout>` tags — which includes the entire LessonLayout structure.

```
Page Content
  └─ LessonLayout (adds sidebar, nav)
       └─ BaseLayout (adds HTML shell, header, footer)
            └─ Final HTML document
```

<Callout type="info">
  There's no limit to nesting depth, but two levels is usually sufficient. Three or more layouts can make the hierarchy hard to follow.
</Callout>

## Named Slots for Complex Layouts

When you need multiple insertion points in a layout, use named slots:

```astro
---
// DashboardLayout.astro
---

<div class="dashboard">
  <header>
    <slot name="header" />
  </header>
  <nav>
    <slot name="sidebar" />
  </nav>
  <main>
    <slot />  <!-- Default slot for main content -->
  </main>
</div>
```

```astro
---
import DashboardLayout from '../layouts/DashboardLayout.astro';
---

<DashboardLayout>
  <h1 slot="header">Dashboard</h1>

  <ul slot="sidebar">
    <li><a href="/dashboard">Overview</a></li>
    <li><a href="/dashboard/settings">Settings</a></li>
  </ul>

  <!-- No slot attribute = goes into the default slot -->
  <div class="metrics">
    <p>Your main dashboard content here.</p>
  </div>
</DashboardLayout>
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Coming from React?">
  Named slots replace the React pattern of passing components as props: `sidebar={<Nav />}`. Both approaches work — Astro's is more declarative (annotating content with `slot="name"`) while React's is more explicit (passing JSX as props). If you've used Vue, Astro's named slots work identically.
</Callout>

## Head Management

Unlike React (where you need `react-helmet` or Next.js `<Head>`), Astro has no special component for managing `<head>` tags. You simply write them directly in your layout:

```astro
---
const { title, description, ogImage } = Astro.props;
const canonicalURL = new URL(Astro.url.pathname, Astro.site);
---

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
  <title>{title}</title>
  <meta name="description" content={description} />
  <link rel="canonical" href={canonicalURL} />

  <!-- Open Graph -->
  <meta property="og:title" content={title} />
  <meta property="og:description" content={description} />
  {ogImage && <meta property="og:image" content={ogImage} />}
</head>
```

This project extracts head management into a `BaseHead.astro` component for reuse. That component receives props from the layout, which receives them from each page. The data flows downward, just like in React.

## Layout Best Practices

1. **Keep layouts thin** — Layouts should handle structure, not business logic. Fetch data in pages, pass it to layouts via props.
2. **Two levels is usually enough** — BaseLayout for the HTML shell, a content-specific layout (BlogLayout, DocsLayout) for the inner structure.
3. **Extract repeated head tags** — Create a `BaseHead.astro` component so you don't duplicate meta tags across layouts.
4. **Use CSS scoped styles** — Layout styles stay scoped to the layout. Child components won't be affected unless you use `:global()`.

## Wrapping Up

Layouts in Astro follow the same composition patterns you know from React, with two key differences:

- **`<slot />`** instead of `{children}` for content injection
- **Named slots** instead of passing components as props

The result is the same: reusable page structures that wrap content in shared UI. Every page in this course flows through `LessonLayout → BaseLayout`, and you can trace that chain by reading the source code in `src/layouts/`.

Next up: Chapter 2, where we explore how Astro handles styling with automatic CSS scoping.
